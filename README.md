# Syllogi

Syllogi is a comprehensive full-stack project developed during university studies. It demonstrates advanced software architecture principles, particularly in server-side development using Node.js.

## Project Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo containing:

1. Client: Built with SolidJS
2. Server: Custom-built Node.js server

## Key Features

### Server

The server is the cornerstone of this project, showcasing:

- **Clean Architecture**: Follows solid principles and clean architecture patterns.
- **Dependency Injection**: Built around a DI container for better modularity and testability.
- **Robust Framework Features**:
  - Custom routing system
  - Concurrency management using workers
  - Security implementation leveraging AWS services
  - Per-route configuration capabilities
- **Database Management**: Utilizes Prisma, a mature JavaScript ORM, for efficient database operations.

### Client

- Developed using SolidJS, a modern, reactive JavaScript library.

## Technical Highlights

- **Software Design & Architecture**: Deep dive into advanced architectural patterns and best practices.
- **API Design**: Thoughtful consideration of RESTful principles and efficient data transfer.
- **Node.js Ecosystem**: Extensive exploration of Node.js capabilities and popular libraries.
